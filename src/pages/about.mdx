This Markdown file creates a page at `your-domain.com/about/`
<iframe src="https://trinket.io/embed/python" width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
It probably isn't styled much, but Markdown does support:
- **bold** and _italics._
- lists
- [links](https://astro.build)
- and more!
